# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To conduct a heuristic evaluation of 2–3 competing websites or apps by analyzing their UX, identifying usability issues, and developing and incorporating necessary design changes to improve overall user experience.

## Algorithm:

Start

Choose 2–3 competing apps/websites from a similar domain (e.g., food delivery: Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats).

Apply Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics to evaluate each app/website:

Visibility of system status

Match between system and real world

User control and freedom

Consistency and standards

Error prevention

Recognition rather than recall

Flexibility and efficiency of use

Aesthetic and minimalist design

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Help and documentation

Document usability strengths and pain points for each platform.

Compare and analyze findings across the chosen apps/websites.

Propose design improvements based on common heuristic violations.

Create low-fidelity wireframes or mockups to reflect the improved designs.

Validate the changes through peer feedback or usability testing.

Finalize the improved UX designs with incorporated changes.
